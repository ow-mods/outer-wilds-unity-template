# Outer Wilds : Unity Template
Template Unity Project with Outer Wilds scripts in it, meant for making AssetBundles to use in mods (such as new horizons).

Works with Unity **2019.4.39f1**. You need to use specifically **this version.** 
Newer versions will not work, as AssetBundles are not forward-compatible.

### How to use

1. Clone the template and load it into Unity with **2019.4.39f1**
2. Read how to use Asset Bundle Browser [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.assetbundlebrowser@1.7/manual/index.html) (I believe in you)
3. Make your content (usually into a prefab)
4. Build it :D
